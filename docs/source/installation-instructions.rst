Installation Instructions
*************************
If you want to quickly test the basic version of TrustChain Android follow :ref:`installing-apk`, if you want to create a version of TrustChain Android with your own features follow :ref:`setting-up-project`.

.. _installing-apk:

Installing TrustChainAndroid APK
================================
In order to install an APK of Android TrustChain as found on GitHub. The only thing you need to do is download the `APK <https://github.com/wkmeijer/CS4160-trustchain-android/blob/master/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk>`_ to your phone and open it to install it. The current minimum version of Android you need is 17 (4.2), however not all features will be available to this version. The recommended version is 21 (5.0) or higher. To manually clear the database on lower versions, simply clear the data of the app in options.

.. _setting-up-project:

Setting up the Android Project
==============================
Follow the steps below if you want to make alterations to the project and add your own functions. If you are already familiar with developing Android native apps and GitHub, this will be trivial.

* `Download and install <https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html>`_ Android Studio
* Make yourself familiar with how Android projects are set up, by reading the `Android Getting Started Guide <https://developer.android.com/training/index.html>`_

	* Note that the guide makes use of the Layout Editor, however writing the xml files directly will give you much better control

* Clone the repository to your work station ``git clone https://github.com/wkmeijer/CS4160-trustchain-android.git``
* Import the project in Android Studio by ``File>Open`` and search for the cloned repository
* Start editing

Note that connecting to an emulator will often not work, so for proper testing you will need two phones.
